<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
*Build a RESTful API using Spring Boot framework
*Connect Spring Boot app (backend) to capstone 1 app (frontend)
*Use Spring Data JPA
*Data model of required entities
*CRUD functionality on all entities
*Database with MySQL
*API Documentation
*The MRS. STACK!
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
*Using Microsoft Whiteboard to draw tables with relationships
*Might add more details to whiteboard to show during presentation
*Using Postman to verify API calls. Use for documentation
*Making tables: user, product, cart
*Using Spring Boot exercise as main reference for REST API
*
<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
*Currently able to create the 3 tables. Added CRUD functionality to all 3. Will connect them later.
*Having issues with the cardinality section. Getting a lot of errors and not getting the desired result
*Using up too much time. Going to start on the React app integration. Added basic GETs for product data.
*My React app does not have a way to change users and adding that feature will eat up too much time. 
*Going to remove User table to follow YAGNI
*Connected Product and Cart tables. Added backend functionality to React app :D
<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
*Definitely need to improve on React skills since I forgot a lot of the React intricacies
*Gotta use hooks to my advantage when doing api calls
*Maybe find out another solution to connecting Product table and Cart table
*Still it all works
*Some of the functionality that I had previously on the React app isn't used so that could be removed/refactor out safely
