<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
*Build a RESTful API using Spring Boot framework
*Connect Spring Boot app (backend) to capstone 1 app (frontend)

*Data model of required entities
*CRUD functionality on all entities
*Database with MySQL
*API Documentation
*The MRS. STACK!

    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
*Using Microsoft Whiteboard to draw tables with relationships
*Might add more details to whiteboard to show during presentation
*Using Postman to verify API calls. Use for documentation
*Making tables: user, product, cart
